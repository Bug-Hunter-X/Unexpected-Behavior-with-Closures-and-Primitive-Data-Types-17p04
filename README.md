This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to closures and primitive data types. The bug occurs due to a misunderstanding of how closures work with primitive types. The `foo` function correctly adds the values and returns the sum in the closure. However, the closure does not change the values of the variables outside. The expected behavior is correct, and no change is required.
